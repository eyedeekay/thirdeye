Ridiculously Easy i2p Jump Service
==================================

This is an i2p Address Helper/Jump service implementation, basically cloned
from the already available one from
[robertfoss/i2pjump](https://github.com/robertfoss/i2pjump) in Go, which some
people prefer, with a few minor differences from the original. For no particular
reason right now, I made it use the SAM bridge to retrieve remote addressbooks,
thereby creating a new destination for every time an addressbook is retrieved
and preventing the upstream addressbook provider from being able to associate a
single long-term identity with retrieving addressbooks. I think this might
de-motivate a rubber-hose attacker who tried to get a jump service owner to
serve incorrect addresses by force, because the jump service operator would have
no way of deciding who to feed bad addresses to. But I mean, if there's a dude
ready to beat you with a hose, he's probably not uncomfortable with just serving
bad addresses to everybody and at any rate, you've probably got bigger problems.
It's just a hypothetical rationale. I've got some other idea for the future,
too, but I'll get to them later. It uses a regular i2p tunnel to provide it's
eepSite, so that does have a long-term destination, which it needs to be useful.
It also stores the list of hosts as a plain text file instead of a database, for
no particular reason but I think it's OK for the small number of hosts for now.

To deploy it, you can just:

    git clone https://github.com/eyedeekay/thirdeye
    cd thirdeye
    make update
